A Qt-based desktop application for viewing and searching .mybible (MySword) modules.

Currently, the main window has the following tabs:

* Bible — for viewing entire chapters or passages,
* Details — displays basic information about the currently selected module,
* Search — you can search your modules for a specific word or phrase here,
* Compare — lets you compare different translations of the same verse,
* Favorites — for organizing your favorite verses with optional comments,
* Dictionary — lists all Strong's numbers and their corresponding definitions,
* Topics (not working yet).

To be continued.
